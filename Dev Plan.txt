TradeBot:
    Summary:
        This module generates actual signals to be used when run. It also provides additional
        additional information when run such as the selected moving averages and the performance
        of those averages. It accepts as input the filename for the price data.
    tradeBot(filename):
        Main function which calls helper functions to analyze the input data and outputs signals
        and other relevant information.
    loadData(filename):
        Loads in and transforms input data to be used by the rest of the program. It also performs
        input validation on the data itself.
    generateMovAvgs(array):
        Returns an array of moving average values for the input array.
    findCrossovers(primaryArray, secondaryArray):
        Returns an array equal in length to the shortest of the two input arrays consisting on 0s,
        1s, and -1s. A 1 indicates the primaryArray crossed above the secondaryArray at that
        index, a -1 indicates the primaryArray crossed below the secondaryArray at that index,
        and a 0 indicates there was no crossover at the index.
    analyzePerformance(priceData, crossovers):
        Returns the difference between the average price at each sell signal and the average price
        at each buy signal. Sell signals are downside crossovers (-1), and buy signals are upside
        crossovers (1).

Testing:
    Summary:
        This module is used for testing the performance of TradeBot. It grabs historical price data
        and pretends to run it every day for a set period of time, saving the output trades and
        analyzing how much an account would change as a result of making those trades.
